The first thing that you'll need to do is sign up for a GitHub.com account. 
It's very straight forward, give your username, password and email address and you're done. 
You're also going to need some sort of browser for the rest of the course. 
Now, I am going to use Google Chrome and I think that's a preferred browser, that's just my personal preference. 
Because it has the Chrome developer tools that are very advanced in terms of web development help. 
But that's not required, you could use any browser you want that you prefer. 
Also, you need some sort of code editor that you're going to use. 
In this course I'm going to use the Atom code editor. 
It's free, it's very good, it has plenty of plug-ins that you can put in to help you code and it's actually also made by GitHub. 
However you don't have to use that one you could use Visual Studio Code, that's also free. 
Brackets.io that's free, Sublime Text 3 is also free but kind of asks you to eventually pay for it. 
So, basically, choose the editor that you like and you're going to be productive in.
